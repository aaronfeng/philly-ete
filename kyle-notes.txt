Unfortunately we didnâ€™t make it to market in time to unseat our competitor.  They had established agreements with first movers and it was decided to suspend the project.  Our company looks at this internally as a technical success - they are in the process of applying / leveraging the team members and several of the technologies on other projects.  Obviously this was disappointing but we showed that the technologies are viable, and they will be re-applied.
